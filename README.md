# Sentiment Analysis 🔍🧠

## 📌 Description

This project focuses on building a **Sentiment Analysis** model that can accurately classify the sentiment of textual data into categories like **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to understand public opinion, analyze customer feedback, and monitor social media trends.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` – Main notebook where the model is implemented and trained using Google Colab.
- `data/` – Folder (optional) for storing dataset files.
- `models/` – (optional) Trained model files or exported versions for inference.
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation.

## 💻 Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- Google Colab ☁️
- Pandas 📊
- NumPy 🔢
- Scikit-learn 🎯
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈 (for visualization)
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or TextBlob (for preprocessing, optional)
- TensorFlow/Keras or other ML libraries (if deep learning is used)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains text samples labeled with sentiment categories. You can use:
- [IMDB Movie Reviews](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
- [Twitter US Airline Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)
- Or any custom dataset of your choice

## ⚙️ Features

- Text preprocessing (removing punctuation, stopwords, lemmatization)
- Data visualization of sentiment distribution
- Model training and evaluation using various classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Accuracy and performance metrics (Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, etc.)
- Sentiment prediction on custom text input
